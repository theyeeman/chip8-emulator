- 4 kb of ram
- display size of 64x32 pixels
- PC (program counter) points to current instruction in memory
- one 16-bit index register called "I" to point at locations in memory
- a stack for 16-bit addresses to call functions and return from them
- 8-bit delay timer which is decremented at a reate of 60 Hz
- 8-bit sound timer which functions like the delay timer but also gives off beeping noise if timer val > 0
- sixteen 8-bit general purposes CPU registers (variable registers)
    - called v0 to vf, but vf is usually used as flag register
